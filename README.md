#Chonburi Font

Chonburi is a province located at the east coast of Thailand.

Chonburi is a Thai and Latin Display typeface that has a high contrast between vertical and horizontal lines. It is suitable to use for headlines and titles in both formal and semi-formal type of work such as in a festival or a ceremony.

A similarity between some glyphs such as [ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ] [ฎ ฏ] [บ ป] [ข ช] is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

There is a specific approach on how to deal with thick and thin stroke for Thai glyphs. In order to develop Thai fonts, it is encouraged to take this font as an example for such method and other developments.

Thai display tyefaces are simplified from a conservative looped or loopless Thai so this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the character of each glyph.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.

Glyphs files (.glyphs) in the source folder can be opened in Glyphs program for further development.
Font files (.ttf and .otf) in the fonts folder are compatible with Window, MacOS, and Linux system.

The Chonburi project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/chonburi
