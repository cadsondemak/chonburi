#Chonburi Font

The objective of this project is to create a Thai and Latin Display typeface. Chonburi is a display typeface with high contrast in a Didone style. This single-weight typeface provides advance typographical support with features such as discretionary ligature. This font can be extended the family to other weights including both narrow and extended version. It is also ready to be matched with other non-Latin script.
